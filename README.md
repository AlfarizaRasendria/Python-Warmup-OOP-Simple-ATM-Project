here's a readme.md file for my object-oriented programming (OOP) ATM simulator program:

### OOP ATM Simulator 
This is a simple ATM simulator program implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. The program allows users to create main accounts and savings accounts, check balances, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts. It demonstrates inheritance and encapsulation concepts in OOP.

## Features
Create a Main Account.
Check the balance of the Main Account.
Deposit funds into the Main Account.
Withdraw funds from the Main Account.
Transfer funds from the Main Account to a Savings Account.
Create a Savings Account.
Check the balance of the Savings Account.
Deposit funds into the Savings Account.
Withdraw funds from the Savings Account.
Transfer funds from the Savings Account to the Main Account.
Exception handling for insufficient balance.
Fee deduction for certain transactions in the FeeAccount class.

# Usage
Run the main() function to start the ATM simulator.
Choose from various options in the menu to perform different operations.

## Classes

1. **CreateMainAccount:**
   - This class is used to create a Main Account.
   - Its primary functionality may include initializing the account with the owner's name and an initial balance.

2. **CreateSavingsAccount:**
   - This class is used to create a Savings Account.
   - Its primary functionality may include initializing the account with the owner's name and an initial balance.

3. **BankAccounts:**
   - A base class serving as the foundation for Main Account and Savings Account.
   - It may implement common operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking that can be inherited by its subclasses.

4. **FeeAccount:**
   - This class inherits from BankAccounts and introduces an additional fee feature for withdrawals.
   - It may include logic to charge an extra fee when performing withdrawals.

5. **SavingsAcct:**
   - This class inherits from FeeAccount and can calculate interest on the account balance.
   - It may include methods to calculate interest and retrieve the balance after interest has been applied.



## How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python installed.
Run the main() function in the atm_simulator.py file.
Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the ATM simulator.
